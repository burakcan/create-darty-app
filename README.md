# [Create Dart App](https://github.com/eserozvataf/create-dart-app)

Dart is a front-end development system to allow developers to start their projects
immediately. By Dart's convention over configuration mindset, webpack and typescript
compiler configurations are handled by dart's itself.

Create Dart App, simply downloads the selected dart project template to make its user
ready for development.


## Quick start

Ensure that `node.js` is installed on your system first.

Use the following commands depending on preset you want to create:
